        <h2>Generative Adversarial Networks</h2>
        <p>To - basically - generate anything with machine learning,
           one has to use a generative algorithm, and at least for now, one of the most powerful generative algorithms for image generation is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
        </p>

        <h2>The invention of the Generative Adversarial Network</h2>
        <p>The invention of GANs was quite unexpected. The famous AI researcher, so a Ph.D. Fellow at the University of Montreal, Ian Goodfellow, came up with the idea while discussing the shortcomings of the other generative algorithms with his friends at a friend's farewell party.
        After the party he came home full of hope and implemented his concept.
        Surprisingly, everything went as hoped in the first attempt and he successfully created the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs for short).
         Yann Lecun, director of AI research at Facebook and professor at New York University:<blockquote>GANs are the most interesting idea of ​​the last 10 years in machine learning.</blockquote>

        <h2>The rough structure of the GAN</h2>
        <p>In a common GAN structure, two agents compete with each other: a generator and a discriminator.
       They can be designed using different networks (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or simply Regular Neural Networks (ANNs or RegularNets).
       Since we will be generating images, CNNs are better suited for this task. Therefore we will build our agents with Convolutional Neural Networks.</p>

        <h2>How does the GAN model work?</h2>
        <p>In short, we're asking the generator to generate handwritten digits without giving it any additional data.
            At the same time, we will bring the existing handwritten digits to the discriminator and ask it to decide whether the images generated by the generator are genuine or not.
            First, the generator produces lousy images, which the discriminator immediately flags as fake.
            After receiving enough feedback from the discriminator, the generator learns to trick the discriminator due to the reduced deviation from the real images.
            Consequently, we get a very good generative model that can give us very realistic results.</p>

        <h2>Creating the GAN model</h2>
        <p>GANs often use computationally complex calculations, and thus GPU-enabled machines will make your life much easier.
            Therefore, one can use Google Colab to reduce training time with GPU acceleration.</p>

        <h2>How do you do image generation yourself?</h2>
        <p>In order to get anything done at all, you have to deal with the topic. Here are some steps to follow for a simple image generation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GPU Enabled Training with Google Colab</li>
            <li>First imports with Google Colab </li>
            <li>Load and process the MNIST dataset</li>
            <li>Creation of the model</li>
            <li>Generator Network</li>
            <li>Discriminator Network</li>
            <li>Configuration of the model</li>
            <li>Setting the checkpoints
            <li>Training the model</li>
            <li>Definition of the training step </li>
            <li>Define the training loop</li>
            <li>Image generation function</li>
            <li>Start training</li>
            <li>Generate Digits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the function of Image Generation tells you something, you can easily do your own image generation with these steps</p>
