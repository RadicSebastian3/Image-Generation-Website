    <h1>The different image generators</h1>

    <section id="s1">
        <h2>Stable Diffusion</h2>
        <p>Stable Diffusion is the inspiration behind this article and a tool I've personally been playing around with a lot lately.
            It runs locally on your computer (so you don't compete for resources with other users of an online tool) and is one of the most powerful you can currently use.
            Not only can you use it to fine-tune a lot of parameters, but you can also control the entire generation process.</p>
        <p>Stable Diffusion suffers from all the same AI pitfalls, with the added "danger" of accessibility.
            Anyone with a powerful enough computer can set it up and get it up and running quickly.
            However, accessibility becomes difficult for inferior hardware.</p>
        <p>The best thing about Stable Diffusion is that it's completely open source. You can implement support for it in any of your projects today if you want, and there are already plugins like Alpaca that you can use to integrate with Photoshop.
            It's not perfect yet, but it's extremely early in the development of these programs.
            You can also use Dream Studio if you want, although it costs money and is a bit restrictive compared to setting up locally.</p>
            <p>In addition, if you set up Stable Diffusion locally, there are forks like AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI that come with a built-in upscale tool that can increase resolution up to four times.
                While you can generate higher resolution images, it is often much faster to generate a lower resolution image and then upscale it.
                All images below are upscaled from lower resolutions.</p>
            <blockquote>Stable Diffusion was trained on a cluster of 4,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs running on AWS and took place over a month. It can generate celebrity images and also has a built-in NSFW filter.
                You can disable this NSFW filter on local installs as it actually saves resources by reducing VRAM usage. What "diffusion" means is the process of starting with pure noise and refining over time.
                This will gradually bring the image closer to the text prompt over time until there is no more noise. Dall-E 2 works in the same way.</blockquote>
            <p>Another fun feature of Stable Diffusion is "img2img".
                In this, you give him an image as a prompt, describe what the image is supposed to be, and then ask for an actual drawing.</p>

        <h2>Craiyon</h2>
        <p>Craiyon was formerly known as the DALL E Mini, although despite the name it is unrelated to the Dall-E 2. It is designed to reproduce the results of OpenAI's DALL·E text-to-image model.
            Craiyon is available to the public and can be used to generate images that are surprisingly decent, although the images are neither as accurate nor of the highest quality.
            The maximum image resolution is 256 x 256, and there are no upscaling tools either.</p>
        <p>Craiyon is completely free to use and accessible through its website.
            You can generate any image from any command prompt and the only catch is that the images are of lower quality and you have to wait about two minutes for each batch of images generated.
            Craiyon started out as an open-source model with the goal of reproducing the results of the original DALL·E model.
            The model now in use is known as the DALL·E Mega and includes several improvements.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the other options here, Craiyon is supported by advertising revenue.
            As a result, you will see paid sponsorship and other advertisements on their site during your visit.
            There is also an app for Android smartphones. It's not the most sophisticated, but it's fun, easy to use, and accessible.</p>

        <h2>Dall-E 2</h2>
        <p>Dall-E 2 is a product of OpenAI research lab and is the most famous AI image generator that people think of.
            It's a closed tool with limited access, but for those who can access it, some of the results it can produce are incredible.
            It was originally closed due to concerns about the ethics and safety of such a tool, although it has been gradually expanded over time.</p>
        <p>One of the greatest advantages of the Dall-E 2 is its ability to create photorealistic images that are indistinguishable from real photos at first glance.
            It can create paintings, images that look like they were taken with real cameras, and completely made-up scenarios.
            When it was first announced, it represented a major leap in the capabilities of AI, both in its ability to create images and in its natural language processing, known as NLP.
            This is thanks to the implementation of GPT-3, which is one of the most advanced language models on the market and also authored by OpenAI.</p>
        <p>Just like Stable Diffusion, Dall-E 2 has its own ability to take existing images and change them based on a prompt.
            You can use it to edit photos by asking it to add something to an image, or even asking it to remove something or change the lighting.
            While it only creates square images, last month OpenAI announced outpainting, which can extend your images more broadly while respecting the context of what's already available in your square image.</p>
        <p>Dall-E 2 is available for everyone to try.</p>

        <h2>Midjourney</h2>
        <p>Midjourney is interesting because it's a public platform that can generate images, although you do it through a Discord server.
            Not only that, but after you've generated 25 images, you'll need to subscribe to the service to keep generating new ones.</p>
        <p>While Midjourney is probably the most accessible platform here (assuming you can access it from any device with a Discord account), it will also cost you money.
            But you get quality for that. A user of the service, Jason Allen, created a play he called "Théâtre D'opéra Spatial".
            He took part in the art competition at the Colorado State Fair and won.</p>
        <p>Unlike these other projects, Midjourney is a proprietary artificial intelligence program.
            There is no source code available for you to view and its entire purpose is limited to use within a Discord server at this time.</p>
