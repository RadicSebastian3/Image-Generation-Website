    <h1>Was ist Image Generation?</h1>
        
    <section id="s1">
        <h2>What is an AI image generator?</h2>
        <p>An AI image generator is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence algorithms to create images
            created from scratch.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="s2">
        <h2>Where can you use it?</h2>
        <p>You can use AI image generators for various purposes, e.g. B. to create images for 3D models,
            Advertising, generating images for blog posts, creating art, etc.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="s3">
        <h2>What are the benefits of using an AI image generator?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>AI image generators can produce high quality art and realistic images much faster than humans
            generate.</li>

            <li>You can help artists come up with ideas for new work they need to make. For example, can
            a concept artist can create many ideas for a video game in less than an hour.</li>

            <li>Anyone can create images and artwork without needing any technical drawing skills.</li>
            <li>AI image generators can quickly and easily generate large numbers of images, making them ideal for
            marketing applications.</li>
            <li>A designer or artist focuses more on the concept and imagination of an image than
            on its technical aspects.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="s4">
        <h2>How can you generate the images?</h2>
        <p>The most common way this technology currently works is:
            The user enters any text into the program, and the program will show you some on it
            based images.</p>
        <p>However, there are many people interested in taking it to the next level, so we others
            Find ways to generate images like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create another image from an existing one.</li>
            <li>Draw a simple sketch and the program will create a complete picture.</li>
            <li>Generating images based on a specific art type, such as B. Pop Art.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="s5">
        <h2>What are the limitations of AI image generators?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1.AI image generators are not always perfect at generating a specific desired image.
                For example, it's difficult to get good results when creating an image with certain details
                want.</li>
            <li>
                2.AI image generators often rely on pre-trained models, so they are only as good as the data they come with
                which they were trained.
                For example, if the AI ​​only trains on abstract images, it will be difficult to create a photorealistic one
                to get.
            </li>
            <li>
                3.Image generators can sometimes produce results that look artificial.
                For example, getting accurate results for human faces is not easy.
            </li>
            <li>4.Knowing what is written into the computer and how is necessary so that the text (prompts)
                gives us the results we want.
                That's why there are sites that let you buy working texts (prompts) so you don't
                have to test so much.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="s6">
        <h2>The problem with AI image generators</h2>
        <p>One problem with using this technology is the possibility
            create fake or altered images and be used in a malicious manner (such as creating
            fake news).</p>
